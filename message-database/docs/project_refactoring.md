# Project Refactoring Documentation

This document outlines the refactoring changes made to the Hostaway Message Database project to improve structure, organization, and maintainability.

## Key Changes

1. **Package Structure Reorganization**
   - Created a proper Python package structure with `message_database` as the main module
   - Moved all core functionality into this package
   - Set up proper imports with absolute paths for better maintainability

2. **Script Organization**
   - Moved all shell scripts to a dedicated `scripts` directory
   - Updated script paths and imports to match the new structure
   - Made scripts more consistent in their parameter handling and error reporting
   - Ensured all scripts are executable

3. **Test Organization**
   - Consolidated all test files into the `tests` directory
   - Structured tests to properly import from the main package

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated the README.md to reflect the new project structure
   - Added a project structure diagram
   - Updated usage instructions

5. **Entry Point Streamlining**
   - Set up proper console entry points in setup.py
   - Created a dedicated daily job script in the scripts directory

## Benefits

The refactoring provides several benefits:

1. **Better Maintainability**: Proper separation of concerns with clear module boundaries
2. **Easier Deployment**: Standardized package structure makes installation simpler
3. **Improved Developer Experience**: Consistent import paths and clear organization
4. **Better Documentation**: Updated docs reflecting the current state of the project

## Removed Files

- Redundant duplicate directories
- Moved but not deleted:
  - Test files moved to tests directory
  - Shell scripts moved to scripts directory
  - Daily job script moved to scripts directory

## Installation After Refactoring

To install the refactored package:

```bash
# Development installation
pip install -e .

# Standard installation
pip install .
```

This allows importing and using the package from anywhere once installed.
